# Pattern-Recognition

Lab exercises for the "Pattern Recognition" course at NTUA

Lab 1: Gaussian Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models and RNNs for Speech Regonition
Lab 2: Used chromagrams and mel spectrograms for temporal and frequency-based representations. Built CNN, RNN, and Audio Spectrogram Transformer models for music genre classification and valence/arousal/danceability regression using MIR datasets.
